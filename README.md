# MechaCar-Statistical-Analysis

## Project Overview
In this assignment, we assist Basil and Sadhana with a project to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

To further analyze earthquake data, Basil and Sadhana requested to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. They would also like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on a new map layer.
